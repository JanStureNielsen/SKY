*This article is a stub.*
*Do not hesitate to substantiate.*

Job Training Programs (JTPs) are used to train workers that have insufficient human capital in order to help them find better jobs and stay unemployed less frequently. 

The first (to our knowledge) meta-analysis of the impact of JTPs on unemployment can be found [here](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-0297.2010.02387.x).
A more recent meta-analysis by the same team can be found [here](http://ftp.iza.org/dp9236.pdf).
