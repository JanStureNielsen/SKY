When answering scientific questions, several tools have to be used. 
A very important set of tools are statistical methods of causal inference.
In this section of SKY, we provide link to three sources on methods of causal inference:

* [Statistical Tools for Causal Inference](inference.html): an online book of tools of learn causal inference and their implementation with R
* [Methodological Guidelines](guidelines.html): a set of methodological guidelines to follow for anyone reporting results to SKY
* [Methodological Frontier](frontier.html): a list of ongoing methodological questions and research projects
