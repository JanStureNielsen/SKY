The Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) is the estimated cost to society of one ton of GreenHouse Gases (GHGs) emitted to the atmosphere, expressed in equivalent tons of CO2. 
It is the key benchmark to which the cost every project trying to fight climate change has to be compared.
Only projects with a cost lower that the SCC per ton of C02 are deemed cost-effective.

Several agencies have reported estimates of the SCC.
The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimates that the SCC is of 30 USD.
