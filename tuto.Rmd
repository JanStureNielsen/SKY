title: 'How to Contribute to SKY: A Tutorial'
---

SKY is actually a collection of projects, so that I have made two tutorials:

* [Contributing an entry on SKY (consensus article, individual research report, methodological guideline)](tutoSKY.html)
* [Contributing an entry to the open source book "Statistical Tools for Causal Inference"](tutoSTCI.html)  

Both projects rely on RMarkdown, but the second one adds a layer with the bookdown package, which requires a little more dexterity.
Awesome broad tutorials for these two tools can be found here:

* [RMarkdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/)
* [Bookdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/)
